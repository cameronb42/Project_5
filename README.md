# Project_API
The goal of this project will be to build a simple REST API in Python and containerize it using Docker. This container image will then be uploaded to the Docker public repository and I will be downloading this image to run it in my local Docker environment for testing.


/md5/<string>
This endpoint will return the MD5 hash of the string that is passed as the input. Ex.: for a string of Hello World the MD5 hash should be b10a8db164e0754105b7a99be72e3fe5. Donâ€™t forget to handle spaces and other special HTTP characters correctly!

/factorial/<int>
This endpoint will return the factorial (product of the integer and all integers below it) for the integer that is passed as input. If the input is not a positive integer, the output should contain and error description.

/fibonacci/<int>
This input will return an array of integers with all the Fibonacci numbers (in order) that are less than or equal to the input number. If the input is not a positive integer, return an error description. 

/is-prime/<int>
This endpoint will return a boolean value depending on whether the input is a prime number. Again, return a descriptive error if the input is invalid.

/slack-alert/<string>
This endpoint is the only one that has a side-effect. Your API should attempt to post the value of the input into a Slack channel in our class Slack team, then return a boolean value that indicates whether the message was successfully posted to the channel.
